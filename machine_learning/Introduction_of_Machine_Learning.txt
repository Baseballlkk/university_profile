1. machine learning
	A. make machine have the ability of looking for a function
	B. eg. Speech learning, Image Recognition, Playing Go

2. Nouns
	A. Regression
		output as a scalar
	B. Classfication
		Given class, output the correct one
	C. Structure Learning
		create a structure thing

3. Step of Machine Learning
	A. function with unknown parameters (guessing model)
		a. weight
			coefficient affect variables
		b. bias
			coefficient that will not affect the variables
	B. define loss from training data
		a. loss
			I.   also a function of parameters
			II.  represent how good a set of values is
	 		III. taking average of error between training data & label
			IV.  loss increasing, quality decreasing
	C. Optimization
		a. gradient desent
			I.  pick a initial value
			II. calculate changing rate
